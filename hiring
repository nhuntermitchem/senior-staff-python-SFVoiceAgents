# Senior–Staff Backend Engineer Opening (SF)

_Last updated: Jan 2026_

## The company
This is an AI-native company building real-time, production voice agents that interact directly with end users at high volume.

The platform handles live conversations, complex decisioning, and integrations with external systems, all under tight latency and reliability constraints.

- Early-stage with strong revenue traction (closing in on $6M ARR in just 2 years)
- Product is live in production, handling large volumes of real-time interactions
- Technology sits at the intersection of AI, voice infrastructure, and backend systems
- Engineering problems are closer to distributed systems than traditional SaaS CRUD apps

## Why this role exists
The company has found PMF is scaling real customer usage in production.

As call volume and use cases expand, backend systems need to become more robust, observable, and scalable. This role exists to help own and evolve 
the core backend that powers live, user-facing AI interactions.

## The actual work
- Own backend systems that support real-time, latency-sensitive workflows
- Design and scale APIs and services used by AI voice agents in production
- Improve system reliability, performance, and fault tolerance
- Work closely with applied AI and product teams to ship new capabilities
- Make architectural decisions with real customer impact
- Balance rapid iteration with production-grade engineering

## The stack (current, not aspirational)
- Primary language: Python, FastAPI, Postgres, Kubernetes, AWS, Langfuse, OpenAI

## Team and collaboration 
- Reports to CTO, former Cambridge 30 under 30 and Ex-Google
- Elite but laid back team
- Small, senior-leaning team with high ownership
- Fast feedback loops and minimal process overhead

## Who is a strong fit
- Senior or Staff-level backend engineer
- Comfortable owning systems that operate in real time
- Experience with scalable, distributed, or event-driven systems
- Enjoys working close to product and end users

## Who is not a fit
- Engineers looking for purely offline or batch systems
- People who prefer very narrow ownership
- Early-career engineers

## Interview process
- Step 1: 30 minute call with the CTO
- Step 2: 1.5 Technical (System Design and Practical Coding)
- Step 3: Onsite
- Expected timeline: ~2 weeks

## Reach out
Happy to share:
- Company name, funding, and investors
- Main projects on the roadmap
- Core target market and growth trajectory
